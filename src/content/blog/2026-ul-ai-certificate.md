I spent **Sep 2025 – Jan 2026** completing an **AI certificate programme at the University of Limerick**.

I decided **not** to continue to the full MSc programme afterwards — not because AI is less important, but because I wanted to bias toward **building real systems** while learning in public.

## What I wanted from structured study

After years in cloud support and DevOps, I noticed a pattern:

- I’m good at debugging systems.
- I’m good at shipping products.
- But I wanted more structured time for **AI fundamentals** so I could design better LLM systems beyond “prompting”.

The certificate gave me the discipline to revisit core ideas and connect them directly to practical projects.

## How it shows up in my projects

### 1) RAG Troubleshooting Assistant

The certificate pushed me to think more carefully about:

- evaluation (not just “looks good”)
- retrieval quality (chunking, embeddings, relevance)
- reliability and UX for technical decision-making

### 2) VideoTranslate

A classic “cloud + AI glue” project:

- event-driven architecture
- automation-first design
- outputs that can be reused downstream (search, subtitles, knowledge bases)

### 3) ArgumentLab

The most personal project:

- turning unstructured content (YouTube) into structured arguments
- enabling comparison, counterpoints, and a personal reasoning trace

## What’s next

This site is now my **growth log**. Instead of hiding work in private repos, I want to:

- publish project write-ups
- keep lightweight demo snapshots
- document decisions and learnings (even the wrong ones)

If you’re reading this during an interview: feel free to click around the **Projects** and **Lab** pages.

> **Update (Feb 2026):** I completed an AI certificate at the University of Limerick (Sep 2025–Jan 2026) and decided not to continue to the full MSc for now. The rest of this post captures my mindset when I wrote it in 2025.

I’ve always been passionate about building practical systems that help people—whether it’s a traffic violation reporting app that empowered civic engagement in Taiwan, or a GPT-based assistant that supports complex DevOps workflows in my current work.

Over the years, I’ve led the development of tools that made real-world impact. One citizen platform I built facilitated over 440,000 traffic violation reports in just one year, helping local governments deliver faster public services. Most recently, I launched Vouchgether, a community-oriented app in Ireland that enables people to share discounts, save money, and support each other.

These experiences have shaped my conviction that while good software solves problems, AI can solve them at scale—with deeper intelligence and wider reach.

As part of the team at National Broadband Ireland, I now support the infrastructure of an entire nation. I’ve observed firsthand how AI can revolutionize network monitoring, predictive fault detection, and customer issue resolution. The opportunity to integrate intelligent systems into national infrastructure is both thrilling and urgent.

To do this well, I don’t just want to apply pre-built AI services—I want to understand how they work, how to build them securely and ethically, and how to adapt them to solve meaningful problems.

That’s why I’m applying to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at one of Ireland’s top institutions—Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, Dublin City University, University of Limerick, University of Galway.

I am not making a career shift—I’m deepening a mission. Just as I once pursued software engineering through my Master’s at QUT, and went on to support global clients at AWS and Verizon, I now want to dedicate myself to the next frontier: AI for public good.

My goal is to build scalable, trustworthy AI systems that empower people and benefit society—starting with the communities and infrastructure here in Ireland.

This Master’s programme is the foundation I need to bring that vision to life.

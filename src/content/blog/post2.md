I’ve always been drawn to building tools that work for people—whether that’s a parking violation app that helped transform citizen reporting in Taiwan, or a GPT-based assistant that augments my own DevOps workflows.

Over the years, I’ve built systems that have had real impact. My citizen-reporting app processed over **440,000 traffic violation cases in a single year**, empowering law enforcement to serve the public more efficiently. More recently, I launched **Vouchgether**, a discount-sharing app built for communities in Ireland to **save money and encourage generosity**.

These projects taught me something important: good software helps people—but **AI has the potential to amplify that impact exponentially**.

As I now work at **National Broadband Ireland**, I’ve already identified many areas where AI can be directly applied to national infrastructure—from intelligent fault detection to smarter resource optimization. The possibilities excite me deeply. And yet, I know that to truly unlock this power, I need deeper knowledge—**not just tools, but principles**.

That’s why I’m applying to **Trinity College Dublin’s MSc in Computer Science (AI Track)**. Trinity’s reputation for academic excellence and cutting-edge research in adaptive computation aligns perfectly with my path. I don’t just want to consume AI APIs—I want to understand how they work, how to build them ethically, and how to scale them responsibly.

This is not a career switch—it’s an evolution of purpose.

Just as I once pursued my passion for software engineering and earned a Master’s degree from QUT, which led me to serve enterprise clients at AWS and beyond, I now feel ready to go deeper. My dream is to **build AI systems that benefit people, communities, and countries**—starting here in Ireland.

This degree is the next step toward that dream.

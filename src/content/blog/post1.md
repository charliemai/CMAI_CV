As my career has grown—from software engineering to global cloud support and now DevOps—I’ve come to realize something powerful: I’ve accumulated a vast body of domain knowledge.

Cloud infrastructure, CI/CD systems, Python automation, debugging strategies, cross-cultural collaboration—these are not just technical checkboxes, but **hard-earned experiences** that helped me support hundreds of organizations, from nimble startups to Fortune 500 clients.

But what if that knowledge could be made searchable, contextual, and continuously growing?  
What if I could build an **AI agent that not only assists me—but evolves with me**?

That’s the vision behind my **self-evolving AI assistant**.

This isn’t just a chatbot—it’s a dynamic semantic system that:
- **understands** my documents,
- **recalls** past support cases and logs,
- and **learns** from our ongoing interaction loop.

Technically, it’s already running:
- Vector embeddings via Pinecone,
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using GPT-4 Turbo,
- Contextual document ingestion and feedback memory loop.

But I’m aiming higher: I want to integrate **reinforcement signals**, **edge-case escalation**, and **human-style validation**, turning it into a **trustworthy knowledge companion**.

Why? Because I believe such a system isn’t just useful—it’s necessary.

In an era of constant information overload, a self-growing AI agent can:
- **Amplify cognition beyond human memory**,
- **Preserve institutional knowledge**, and
- **Empower DevOps engineers, researchers, and even entire governments** to make better decisions, faster.

And this isn’t theoretical—I’ve lived it.

Just like I once passionately pursued programming and earned my Master’s in IT at QUT, leading to high-impact roles at global companies like AWS, I’m now ready to enter the next frontier: **AI research and development**.

With Trinity College Dublin’s MSc in Computer Science (AI Track), I seek to complement my practical expertise with a deeper theoretical foundation in adaptive systems, machine learning architectures, and responsible AI development.

As someone currently serving at **National Broadband Ireland**, I’m deeply motivated to bring these skills back to the country I now call home. My long-term vision is to help Ireland build not just AI tools—but **AI collaborators**, systems that **elevate human intelligence** while preserving well-being.

My goal is not just to build a tool—but a partner.  
An AI agent that grows with me, works alongside me, and helps others grow too.

## Why I’m doing this

I started the **MSc (Negotiated Learning) at University College Dublin** in **Sep 2025**.

My goal isn’t “collecting a degree” — it’s creating a **repeatable learning system**:

- learn the foundations in a structured way
- build small demos to turn concepts into intuition
- write down decisions, mistakes, and what I’d do differently

This page is the **root index** of that system.

## How this section of the site works

Each course/module will have its own page under **/learning**.

For each module, I aim to publish:

1. **Notes** (clear and searchable)
2. **One tiny demo** (a page in `/lab` or a simulated UI)
3. **A reflection** (what I learned, what was hard, what changed my thinking)

Even if a demo isn’t fully functional, I still ship a UI prototype — because this is about **showing growth**, not perfection.

## What’s coming next

I’ll add module pages here as soon as the semester progresses.

Planned structure for module pages:

- Overview + what the module is really about
- Key concepts
- My build/demos
- What I would do differently next time
- Links to related projects (e.g. RAG assistant, VideoTranslate, ArgumentLab)

## Related learning

- I also completed a **Graduate Certificate in AI at the University of Limerick (Sep 2025 – Jan 2026)**.
  That certificate helped me connect AI fundamentals to real projects.
